# Test Plan

## Goal
- What change are we validating?

## Scope
- In scope:
- Out of scope:

## Repo signals
- Language/framework:
- Test runner(s):
- Unit command(s):
- Integration command(s):
- CI expectations (coverage/junit/artifacts):

## Risk areas (prioritize)
- Data/schema changes:
- Auth/permissions:
- Concurrency/eventual consistency:
- External integrations:

## Unit tests (fast)
- Behaviors to cover:
- Edge cases:
- Negative/error cases:

## Integration tests (real boundaries)
- Dependencies required (DB/queue/cache/etc):
- Test data/fixtures strategy:
- Setup/migrations/seed:
- Isolation/cleanup:

## Commands to run
- Narrowest local command:
- Full suite / regression command:

## Diagnostics
- What logs/artifacts to capture on failure:

## Acceptance
- What does “done” look like?
- What risks remain (if any)?
