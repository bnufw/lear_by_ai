A1,"Scaffold Vite React TS app (pnpm)","Initialize Vite+React+TypeScript project with pnpm scripts; add minimal routing and pages: Repo Input, Plan, Chapter","`pnpm dev` renders pages and navigation works; `pnpm build` succeeds","manual: pnpm install; pnpm dev; pnpm build","manual",DONE,TODO,TODO,"package.json|vite.config.*|src/**|index.html",none,"Keep structure Vercel-friendly; Manual checklist: pnpm dev (verify nav Repo↔Plan, open Chapter 1), pnpm build"
A2,"Add Gemini proxy API (/api/llm)","Implement Vercel Serverless Function calling Gemini using env `GEMINI_API_KEY`; define request/response contract, timeouts, safe errors","Frontend never sees API key; `/api/llm` responds with expected JSON and handles error cases with stable codes","manual: set env; call endpoint locally or on Vercel preview; verify error paths","context7:resolve-library-id|context7:query-docs",DONE,TODO,TODO,"api/llm.*|api/**",A1,"No server-side persistence of user data; Manual checklist: set GEMINI_API_KEY (+ optional GEMINI_MODEL, GEMINI_API_VERSION=v1beta); POST /api/llm with JSON body containing prompt=hi returns ok:true and outputText; invalid JSON -> 400 BAD_REQUEST; missing GEMINI_API_KEY -> 500 CONFIG_MISSING; non-POST -> 405 METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED"
A3,"Define domain models + Zod schemas","Create types and Zod schemas for Session, RepoSource, ChapterPlan, Chapter, Task, Message, QuizAttempt; include versioning","Schemas validate LLM outputs; schema errors are detectable and actionable","pnpm test (Vitest)","none",DONE,TODO,TODO,"src/domain/**|src/lib/schema/**",A1,"Prefer strict schema; allow safe degradation"
A4,"Implement local persistence (IndexedDB)","Add storage layer for sessions, progress, Q&A history, quiz attempts; support basic migration/versioning","Reload restores last session; storage handles schema version change without crashing","pnpm test (Vitest) + manual: complete a chapter then refresh and confirm restore","none",DONE,TODO,TODO,"src/storage/**",A3,"Prefer IndexedDB; cap payload sizes"
A5,"Public GitHub repo ingestion (lightweight)","Parse GitHub URL; fetch default branch and select limited files (README, docs, configs, entrypoints); enforce caps for files/bytes/depth","Given a public repo URL, app builds a context bundle within caps; clear UX for not found, rate limit, oversized repos","pnpm test (Vitest, mocked fetch) + manual: try 2 public repos","none",DONE,TODO,TODO,"src/github/**|src/lib/fetch/**",A3,"Treat repo text as untrusted input; never execute fetched code; Manual: try 2 public repos in UI still pending"
A6,"Prompt orchestration: plan, chapter, Q&A, quiz","Implement prompt builders and orchestrators; enforce structured outputs (JSON) for plan/chapter/quiz; include retry and safe fallback","Plan + Chapter 1 generated reliably; Q&A grounds answers in provided context bundle; invalid JSON triggers retry/degrade","pnpm test (Vitest)","none",TODO,TODO,TODO,"src/llm/**|src/prompts/**",A2|A3|A5,"Add prompt-injection guardrails; keep prompts versioned"
A7,"UI learning flow end-to-end","Wire UI: repo input → plan view → chapter view; task checklist; mark complete; CTA continue vs quiz; show saved history","User completes a chapter and sees persisted state; loading/error UX is clear; flow matches Acceptance Checklist in plan","pnpm e2e (Playwright) or manual checklist if E2E blocked","manual",TODO,TODO,TODO,"src/pages/**|src/components/**|src/app/**",A1|A4|A6,"If Playwright blocked, document manual steps and flag risk"
A8,"Deep open-ended quiz + grading + review","Generate 3–5 deep Q&A questions after chapter; collect user answers; grade with rubric and provide feedback; store attempts and allow review","Quiz can be started after chapter completion; grading/feedback shown; attempt persists and is reviewable after reload","pnpm test (Vitest) + manual: complete a quiz then reload and review attempt","manual",TODO,TODO,TODO,"src/quiz/**|src/pages/**",A4|A6|A7,"Keep rubric stable to make attempts comparable"
A9,"Safety limits + error hardening","Add input/output size caps, request cancellation, stable error mapping, and UX messaging; ensure server does not store prompts by default","Oversized repos or long inputs fail safely with guidance; LLM/network failures surface actionable messages","manual: attempt oversized inputs; force API errors; verify no crashes","manual",TODO,TODO,TODO,"api/**|src/**",A2|A5|A7,"Record remaining risks in README"
A10,"Docs for local run + Vercel deploy","Write README with setup, env vars, deploy steps, privacy stance, limitations, troubleshooting","A new user can deploy on Vercel and run MVP end-to-end following README","manual: follow README steps on a clean environment","manual",TODO,TODO,TODO,"README.md",A7|A9,"Do not include secrets; include limitation notes"
A11,"Regression pass (MVP)","Run declared tests and smoke flows; fix critical issues; finalize MVP checklist","`pnpm test` passes; `pnpm build` passes; E2E or manual checklist passes; checklist items satisfied","manual: pnpm test; pnpm build; pnpm e2e (or manual checklist)","manual",TODO,TODO,TODO,"N/A",A1|A2|A3|A4|A5|A6|A7|A8|A9|A10,"Only mark Review/Regression DONE after actually running the Test_Methods"
